<strong>Iridian fog</strong> pours off green wheat shadowed by palm fronds; near­by, an ancient via­duct spans the baby blue ice cre­vasse, lead­ing event­ually to a cliff-hung sand­stone kiosk.

<p>
Caped figures scuttle between wind­mills on clay battle­ments, rain­ing down ray­gun fire on a terrace where rit­ual braz­iers burn candy apple red; below, a tang­erine valley cradles col­onnaded buttes, rock-cut doors, store-caves, a flower harvester...

Wherever this world is, I’m not there right now; in fact, I never really did get to visit.

<p>
I’m day­dreaming from a travel­ogue, collating stray impress­ions caught from the nacre­ous air; I’m watch­ing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQI7Yrsvzfc" target="_blank">Love Gameplay HD</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLvXzBi6gE4" target="_blank">My hastely made Love techtree intro</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oCubrkh5F8" target="_blank">Love Alpha – Bali Chill Groove (Time Lapse)</a>.

I’m stuck on an inter­minable start screen — a fly­over of some myst­erious planet strung with pennant banners & chase lights — look­ing for a server voucher on a Way­back Mach­ine snap­shot of gaminglove.net circa 2012...

<strong>What is Love?</strong> Put simply, it’s a now-dormant <del>massively</del> moder­ately multi­player <abbr title="first-person shooter">FPS</abbr>-<abbr title="real-time strategy">RTS</abbr> whats­it written from scratch, in C, by a lone Swedish pro­grammer named Eskil Steenberg (<abbr title="doing business as">dba</abbr> <a href="https://quelsolaar.com/" target="_blank">Quel Solaar</a>).
</p>
<p>
A hugely ambitious project, <cite>Love</cite> began develop­ment some­time around 2006, with its first pub­lic release, an alpha build which could be down­loaded from Quel Solaar’s website for €3, appear­ing in October 2009 – more than half a year before Notch an­nounced the re­lease of <cite>Minecraft</cite>’s alpha in June 2010.
</p>
<p>
Why <cite>Minecraft</cite>? Well, they’re both indie first-person sand­box build­ing games with proced­urally gen­erated worlds, deform­able terrain, multi­player servers, styl­ized graphics, dyn­amic weather, day-night cycles, craft­ing systems… both were ins­pired by Zach & Tarn Adams’ <cite>Dwarf Fortress</cite> – and, Notch and Steenberg are fellow Swedes; Notch even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/love-man-will-improve-minecraft-graphics" target="_blank">asked</a> Steenberg – an early member of <a href="https://www.opengl.org/" target="_blank">OpenGL</a>’s Architectural Review board – for assist­ance in implem­enting some OpenGL exten­sions on the notor­iously Java-based <cite>Minecraft</cite>.
</p>
<p>
Take one look at <cite>Love</cite> & Steenberg’s wizardry as a graphics researcher shows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Four-colored fog (near, far, toward sun, away from sun)
</li>
<li>
Anamorphic lens flare
</li>
<li>
Indirect illumination
</li>
<li>
Cloth simulation
</li>
<li>
Inverse kinematics
</li>
<li>
Splatting
</li>
<li>
Bokeh-like particle emitters
</li>
<li>
A faintly strobing noise filter.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Though the geo­metry is crude, though those sur­faces are descr­ibed with flat colors ins­tead of dense, photo­graphic text­ures, and though the over­all image is soft and smudgy (and prone to give some players head­aches), <cite>Love</cite>’s visual gambit pays off with a hallucin­atory impress­ionism that's dynamic, begui­ling, prim­eval & aeol­ian yet vaguely <cite>Star Wars</cite>, and spang­led with ex­amples of un­usual tech­nical ingen­uity – <s>pro­grammer art</s> in the most ad­miring sense of the term.

<strong>A canopy</strong> flaps in the same wind that prop­agates a brush fire.
</p>
<p>
Blaster beams cast light be­neath them­selves as they cleave the earth from already-erod­ing can­yons.
</p>
<p>
Weather ball­oons sail through curli­cue clouds, over a curved hori­zon.
</p>
<p>
It’s not merely the opti­cal god that Steenberg’s tech­nical cunning serves; the whole idea be­hind <cite>Love</cite>, in a sense, is to bring its constit­uent parts into fluent conv­ersation with each other.
</p>
<p>
Whatever features Steenberg decided to imple­ment are inten­ded to multi­ply the means by which <cite>Love</cite>’s players can inter­act with each other & with the world: thus wind­mills can be built to gen­erate power, to spread fires & to push ball­oons; radio freq­uencies can be set up to listen for rem­ote acti­vation codes as well as to secure priv­ate chat channels for ex­chang­ing crit­ical coörd­inates; those same coörd­inates can be access­ed from <cite>Doom 3</cite>-style mouse­look-driven video term­inals; the hori­zon curves be­cause the plan­et is act­ually spher­ical (the in-game map is even a globe holo­gram) – go far enough in one dir­ection & you’ll end up where you start­ed; like­wise, what’s day on one side will be night on the other.
</p>
<p>
This mono­modal, syst­emic approach, the sort that won con­verts more recent­ly with titles like <cite>Breath of the Wild</cite> – in con­cert with the strange­ly lo-fi yet high tech graphics – prov­okes a feel­ing of fresh­ness & sincer­ity that’s linger­ed in my mind ever since first encount­ering the game in maybe 2011 or 2012, though I don't re­call if that was on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/" target="_blank">Rock Paper Shotgun</a> or the pion­eering <abbr title="video game">VG</abbr> photo­graphy blog <a href="https://deadendthrills.com/" target="_blank">Dead End Thrills</a>.

<strong>Of course</strong> the irony’s not lost on me that a game whose ex­press mission was to counter the pre­vail­ing trend of video game as amuse­ment park ride – to offer no <s>cine­matic</s> exper­iences save those that em­erge organic­ally from the con­fluence of syst­ems & player agency – is for me this evan­escent non-place re­turned to only in 480p You­Tube clips and decade-old web­zine screen­shots.
</p>
<p>
In some ways that fugi­tive leg­acy is apt, though, since <cite>Love</cite> never really mat­ured past its embry­onic prom­ise into an act­ual game <i>qua</i> game.
</p>
<p>
In the days be­fore Early Access, <cite>Love</cite> was pro­posed as a contin­uously exp­anded & re­fined experi­mental mini-<abbr>MMO</abbr> (about 200 users per server) whose player base – their disco­veries, procliv­ities, emer­gent social dyn­amics – would guide & shape the course of the proj­ect’s develop­ment.
</p>
<p>
Even now it’s hard for me to give – or guess – the abs­tract for <cite>Love</cite>’s meta­game.
</p>
<p>
Ok, a player gets a voucher, joins a server, and is dropped into an inst­ance of this dreamy alien world – about 1.5 km in circum­ference; suppos­edly they look around for a <dfn>mono­lith</dfn>, a special <dfn>token</dfn> which is driven into the ground to found a <dfn>settle­ment</dfn>; they meet up with other play­ers on the server & whether alone or as a party exp­lore the envi­rons & raid <abbr>NPC</abbr> fort­resses to bring mater­ials (min­eral, clay, flower, water, gas & anti­matter) & techno­logies (weapons & tokens) back to their settle­ment to im­prove it; the text crawl on the start screen ment­ions some MacGuffin – <s>The Arti­fact</s> – which I think may­be one of the five <abbr>AI</abbr> tribes is hoard­ing? bring it back to your settle­ment?
</p>
<p>
Even if play­ers follow this gen­eral loop, what’s the end­game? Steenberg was ada­mant when design­ing <cite>Love</cite> that there be no hard-coded player pro­gression: no level­ing, no rank­ing – heck, no priv­ate prop­erty – the idea being to have <q>a comm­unal invent­ory that play­ers share</q>, situ­ated immed­iately with­in & on top of the actual 3D environ­ment.
</p>
<p>
Fair enough but, especi­ally with­out the usual <abbr>RPG</abbr> carrots, it seems the engine for player motiv­ation never really got locked in, whether the intent­ion was for per­petual sand­castle re­build­ing or a finite space opera grail quest – and neither were there ever enough dedic­ated play­ers to write their own epic poli­tical cons­piracy à la <cite>EVE Online</cite>.

<p class="incipit">
<strong>In a 2011</strong> preview for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/eskil-steenberg" target="_blank">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, Quintin Smith exp­ressed his con­cern that play­ers might quick­ly run out of things to do & that, while Steenberg was push­ing <cite>Love</cite> as a co­öper­ative game, Smith be­lieved that the frame­work might better support comp­etitive multi­player:
</p>

<blockquote>
You could have mult­iple forts of pioneers duking it out, cutting one an­other’s power, or infil­trating the oppos­ition’s base to re­direct their new art­illery piece at their allies.
</blockquote>

<p>
For all of <cite>Love</cite>’s pre­science, it seems it came just shy of pred­icting what Morgan Park in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-future-of-battle-royale-is-here-and-theres-no-circle/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a> called the <dfn>raid game</dfn>: the shoot & loot <abbr>PvPvE</abbr> form­at exemp­lified by post-<abbr>PUBG</abbr> eff­orts like <cite>Hunt: Showdown</cite> & <cite>Escape from Tarkov</cite>.
</p>
<p>
This new breed of shooter bridges the gaps be­tween round-based player elimin­ation, resource-ratio­ning surv­ival & <abbr>MMO</abbr>-like persist­ence & quests; per­haps some sim­ilar config­uration could have served <cite>Love</cite> better than the hand­waved hippie dippy mech­anism design under which it ulti­mately fizz­led out.
</p>
<p>
Still, I cert­ainly have more conf­idence in the fract­al design appr­oach Steenberg en­dorses than in the mini­game buffet of some­thing like <cite>Spore</cite>.
</p>
<p>
Steenberg:
</p>

<blockquote>
Why not make a real world with a sort of cause and effect, like a strat­egy game, so the game is sort of like a strat­egy game where you play first person as one of the units. Then on top of that you have a larger obj­ective which is sort of like your civil­ization game. So you imag­ine a civil­ization v. a simul­ation game, and each battle is an RTS game, and then with­in that each unit is an FPS game.

<strong>Though Love</strong> may have strugg­led to find its core drama­tic hook, there can be no doubt that it stuck to its <del>guns</del> blasters.
</p>
<p>
It is soft­ware as art, built from first princi­ples; look around at the other proj­ects on Quel Solaar’s website & you’ll see much the same – but, per­haps even more impress­ively, these other offer­ings aren’t games but <em>tools</em>: tools as art; as toys, provoc­ations, creat­ive wedges for dis­lodging accept­ed wis­dom.
</p>
<p>
<dfn>Loq Airou</dfn> is a 3D model­ing pro­gram control­led sole­ly with the mouse; rather than poly­gon meshes or <abbr title="non-uniform rational b-spline">NURBS</abbr>, it uses creased sub­division sur­faces to de­scribe obj­ects, and, with the help of snap-to-vertex & a radial menu brought up with the middle mouse button, funct­ions as a sort of sketch­pad for geo­metry – the very same geo­metry Steenberg ported straight into <cite>Love</cite>, with no further detail­ing in a sec­ond appli­cation like, say, Blender.
</p>
<p>
If you watch him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khmFGThc5TI" target="_blank">demo</a> the pro­gram you’ll see a dist­inct lack of tool­bars, drop­down menus, or really any window­ing at all; in­stead you’ll see a wire­frame cage that looks to be made of lasers, a smooth blue shaded shell, face select­ion widg­ets in the form of trans­lucent patches of <abbr title="cyan magenta yellow">CMY</abbr> hex grid & edit actions con­firmed with indigo-fringed ana­morphic flares.
</p>
<p>
<dfn>Ministry of Flat</dfn>: an auto­mated <abbr>UV</abbr> unwrapper.
</p>
<p>
<dfn>Seduce</dfn>: an edit­or for 3D <abbr>GUI</abbr> widg­ets.
</p>
<p>
<dfn>Confuse</dfn>: a pro­ced­ural char­acter anim­ation lib­rary/viewer.
</p>
<p>
<dfn>Nil Salentin</dfn>: a mini­mal non­linear video editor.

<dfn>Stellar</dfn>: a light con­troller.

<p>
And on top of all this is Quel Solaar’s cus­tom net­work proto­col <dfn>Verse</dfn>; pro­grams connec­ted to a Verse server share mut­able data be­tween each other in real-time, incl­uding 3D obj­ects, so that any edits made in one pro­gram will prop­agate inst­antly to an­other – pre­figuring today’s trend, still in its adol­escence, to­ward virtu­alized geo­metry pipe­lines.
</p>
<p>
Though I sus­pect they’re more or less un­usable to any­one but their inv­entor, each of these pro­grams – window­less, per­spect­ival, anim­ated (<q>Most people are horri­fied by the idea of an anim­ated UI</q>) – is a chall­enge to the reign­ing <abbr>UI</abbr> ortho­doxy set by Autodesk & Adobe.
</p>
<p>
 Designed to make the most common tasks im­mediate & joy­ful & to mini­mize distract­ions, the brazen, almost dream­like inter­faces in Quel Solaar’s cata­log are... aspir­ational.
</p>
<p>
They’re <em>cool</em> – I mean, dorky, but <b>cool</b> – just so genuine­ly <b>sci-fi</b>: movie fanta­sies of soft­ware you can act­ually run on your crappy lap­top.

<strong>I think</strong> it's that cock­tail of demo­scene brav­ura, Art Deco grand­eur & aff­ably passion­ate, slight­ly janky pie-in-the-sky obstin­ance that keeps me coming back to the what-ifs of <cite>Love</cite> & its creator.
</p>
<p>
Much like he pers­isted toil­ing away in a small dark apart­ment in Sweden, deliver­ing up­dates like <cite>Avail</cite> & <cite>Dark Matter Spreads Over Fair Land</cite> to never more than a few hun­dred play­ers, noble fail­ures like <cite>Love</cite> per­sist in the fossil rec­ord, as it were, open­ing for the curious onto alter­native hist­ories.
</p>
<p class="halmos">
With its presc­ience & its ingen­uity, <cite>Love</cite> troub­les the recei­ved hist­ory of comp­uter gaming & its short­list of innovat­ors; and ten years if not more since first catch­ing sight of it on the blogs, it still mints an eer­ily serene and <i>sui gen­eris</i> mood, haunt­ing the heav­ens with zod­iacal dust from a gal­axy far, far away.
