Peering in on SpyParty

<p class="incipit">
<strong>Around</strong> this time last year, after near­ly a decade of develop­ment, Chris Hecker's <cite>SpyParty</cite> went into Early Access.
</p>
<p>
A strident­ly asym­metric duel of decep­tion, <cite>SpyParty</cite> is what Hecker likes to call a <s>reverse Turing test</s>: one player, the spy, attempts to blend in with the crowd at a cock­tail party while in­dulging in such pleni­potent­iary antics as se­ducing the Queen of Eng­land, blurt­ing out non sequiturs & pre­tend­ing to read books before put­ting them back in the wrong shelf; player 2, as the sniper, watches in on the af­fair from a dis­tance, try­ing to finger their human prey among the mot­ley jumble of schmooz­ing <abbr>NPC</abbr>s.
</p>
<p>
The spy has a check­list of mis­sions; the sniper has one shot; 3 minutes, give or take, on the clock.
</p>
<p>
Will the spy go un­detected?
</p>
<p>
Will the sniper shoot on a hunch?
</p>
<p>
Will an innocent civil­ian eat a lead hors d'oeuvre?
</p>
<p>
It's a mil­lion dollar idea; a prem­ise from on high; and, having got­ten my hands dirty this last year dead drop­ping micro­films & zoom­ing in on ambas­sadors' asses, I'm struck more and more not just by the game's elegant high concept but by the genuine­ly <i>sui generis</i> & even quiet­ly sub­versive ingen­uity of its exe­cution, from the dens­ity of vis­ual de­tail to the un­ortho­dox con­trol scheme.
</p>
<p>
Before we get into the practic­als, though, I do think a bit of pipe puf­fing is in order.

Panoptic con
</h3>
<hr/>

<p>
Hope­fully the elev­ator pitch was enough to get your in­ner philo­sopher pull­ing his beard; and it's not just a clever con­cept; <cite>SpyParty</cite> is at every moment a tense & demand­ing thrill­er: sweat­ing under the spot­light of your own self-center­ing <a href="http://www.spyparty.com/2014/04/27/spies-narcissism-egocentrism-and-solipsism/" target="_blank">biases</a>; decid­ing, dizzy & desper­ate, which stop to get off the <i>Yomi Ex­press</i>; pin­ning back your eye­lids, fumb­ling your mnemon­ics, pray­ing your last-ditch frame job sticks, all while play­ing what looks like a Clue ex­pansion for <cite>The Sims</cite>.
</p>
<p>
Hecker has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXnoW2SvQrQ" target="_blank">vocal</a> over the years about the lip serv­ice that gets paid to video games' potent­ial for story­telling while the same old orcs & elves get their sub­surface scatter­ing glow-up.
</p>
<p>
It might seem funny that Hecker put­ting his money ( liter­ally his savings from Maxis & then some ) where his mouth is has resulted in a Poker-like indie e­sport; but if any­thing I think this proves that if you're serious about em­bracing the ludic possibil­ities of sub­tle human-scale be­havior, of a whole branch low down on the tree of games heavy with sweet, ripe fruit — that branch being <i>eti­quette</i> — then you simply <b>must</b> attend.

<h3>
Play it off legit
</h3>
<hr/>

<p>
The crux of <cite>SpyParty</cite>'s distinct­ion, its fund­amental contriv­ance, is the un­ambi­guous asym­metry of the actor­/spectator dynamic.
</p>
<p>
While titles like <cite>Assassin's Creed: Brother­hood</cite> or <cite>The Ship</cite> ventured into the waters of hiding in plain sight via <abbr>NPC</abbr> panto­mime, <cite>SpyParty</cite>'s ex­plicit separ­ation of the two roles — as well as its shrink­ing the stage and roster of suspects — opens up a shock­ing amount of room for deep, granul­ar, highly skilled play.
</p>
<p>
Newbies some­times have a hard time ac­climating to this courtly sever­ity; they might think that it's noth­ing but char­acter select­ion shenan­igans, or the sniper, say, forgets that they win if the spy doesn't complete mis­sions.
</p>
<p>
It's not that the game doesn't allow for cheeky man­euvers, it just takes a little commit­ment to fathom what's being asked of you, to men­tally corral the vari­ous checks & balances, to ap­preciate the calli­graphy on the cordial invit­ation, even if you, ir­redeem­able slob that you are, feel you must de­cline.
</p>
<p>
So while some might bounce off a com­petitive multi­player video game simply for expect­ing them to com­plete a tutor­ial, the more or less level skill floor <cite>SpyParty</cite> offers new play­ers is, to my mind, worth the pre­ceptial front-load­ing.
</p>
<p>
<cite>SpyParty</cite>'s em­phasis on em­pathy & com­posure like­wise facil­itates a refresh­ingly adult com­munity spirit, one which stress­es mentor­ing, analys­is & civil­ity over locker room shit talk and bloody knuck­led wood­shedding.
</p>
<p>
Not to suggest that there's no dex­terity in­volved; act­ually the pro­portion of <em>micro</em> gives <cite>SpyParty</cite> much of its unusual texture. 
</p>
<p>
Spies don't just click on their de­sired destin­ation as in an <abbr title="real-time strategy">RTS</abbr> but must be steer­ed there man­ually, taking slow, purpose­ful strides (or wheel-spins, as the case may be) toward out­lined floor pads or conver­sation circles, care­ful not to stop until their feet are plant­ed secure­ly with­in one of these de­limited zones.
</p>
<p>
Once in­side, they're pre­sented with a list of binary opt­ions: an <dfn>innocent action</dfn> (one that can be done by the other party­goers) & a <dfn>spy action</dfn> (one that can­not, and that often helps to fur­ther mission pro­gress).
</p>
<p>
Choose to per­form a spy act­ion and you'll be prompt­ed with a <cite>Gears of War</cite> re­load-style <s>action test</s>: hit green & your leger­demain will be near-invis­ible; hit white & there may be a tell; hit red and... where'd that waiter go with the drinks?
</p>
<p>
All the while, you'll be swivel­ing the camera around, get­ting a read of the room, seeing who's where & plan­ning your next move.
</p>
<p>
It feels weird at first; well, that feel­ing is called <b>rad­ical game design</b>: third person pup­petry estranged and recon­structed.
</p>
<p>
And though timing is crit­ical & you'll want to have a good <s>bounce</s> / re­direct path in your tool­kit, micro stays micro — present but sub­ordinate.
</p>
<p>
The sniper gets to click some buttons too: be­sides pan­ning and zoom­ing, they can high­light guests they want to keep an eye on or low­light those who, like the bar­tender, they know couldn't pos­sibly be the spy.
</p>
<p>
On that note, why don't more first-person games let players use ray­casts for flag­ging, tag­ging & sort­ing visual hier­archies?
</p>
<p>
A valuable bit of sniper tech is focus­ing your laser some­where other than where you're look­ing; why don't more first-person games get players to look away from the center of the screen?
</p>
<p>
Radical.
</p>
<p>
Alter­nating be­tween the two modes each round helps keep fatigue at bay by shift­ing stress to differ­ent loci; again, the genius of <cite>SpyParty</cite>'s exe­cution lies in its vari­egation: not just between the princ­iple roles, but among its select­ion of mis­sions, venues & char­acters.

<h3>
Ambient occlusion
</h3>
<hr/>

<p>
In most games of <cite>SpyParty</cite>, the spy must com­plete so many mis­sions from a list of <var>n</var>, say 4 of 6; the sniper knows the 6 mis­sions avail­able, but not which 4 the spy will choose to com­plete, or in which order.
</p>
<p>
Currently, the missions are:
<ul>
<li>
Bug Ambassador
</li>
<li>
Fingerprint Ambassador
</li>
<li>
Contact Double Agent
</li>
<li>
Purloin Guest List
</li>
<li>
Seduce Target
</li>
<li>
Transfer Microfilm
</li>
<li>
Inspect Statues
</li>
<li>
Swap Statue
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
While some are obvi­ously sib­lings, each has its own flavor, its own chal­lenges, tells, opportun­ities & val­ences; flow­ing from one into the next is such an art, such a delicious­ly subtle, supple groove to feel for, it makes most other games' goal-seek­ing seem brutish by compar­ison. 
</p>
<p>
<dfn>Seduce</dfn>, for example, must be chip­ped away at by sidling up next to your target & trigger­ing a stand­ard talk anim­ation; no tells to speak of, un­less that voyeur watch­ing through the window pairs you with your favor­ite conver­sation partner; these come-ons, however, are on a cool­down & must be spaced out, requiring you put some dist­ance be­tween your­self and your prey before swoop­ing back in to seal the deal.
</p>
<p>
<dfn>Seduce Target</dfn> is general­ly consider­ed a free­bie, the bread & butter of most spies' diet: it's a nice way to get things done while look­ing like you're doing nothing; but time manage­ment is a killer, and your Lothario might get the cold shoulder at just the wrong moment, forcing his once-leisure­ly self to give un­gentle­manly chase.
</p>
<p>
Both players are constant­ly respond­ing to the funct­ion's unceas­ing flow: the sniper's look­ing for patterns and ex­ceptions in the human kaleido­scope; the spy is looking for cover; and what better dis­guise for this neutral <i>alea</i> than the ambi­ent chaos of a ( third ) party?
</p>
<p>
Visibil­ity is huge: sight­lines & occluders con­tribute signifi­cantly to the ident­ity of each venue, from <dfn>Teien</dfn>'s <i>shōji</i> to <dfn>Court­yard</dfn>'s cent­ral ped­estal to the most recent ad­dition, <dfn>Aqua­rium</dfn>, with its great white shark swim­ming at inter­vals across the glass pros­cenium (place­holder till they secure Dopefish?).
</p>
<p>
But it's on <dfn>Balcony</dfn> where the theme of hiding in plain sight reaches a cres­cendo.
</p>
<p>
Origin­ally con­ceived as <cite>SpyParty</cite>'s quick­fire arcade variant, Hecker soon realized he'd under­estimated how mis­chievous his brain­child can truly be.
</p>
<p>
<dfn>Balcony</dfn> is <cite>SpyParty</cite> reduced to its essence; taunt­ingly un­cluttered, its laser-like focus reveals just how gran­ular this stuff gets.
</p>
<p>
And while this venue arg­uably re­presents the paper knife edge of <cite>SpyParty</cite>'s <i title="understated sophistication">shibui</i>, the pro­ject's thorough commit­ment to subtlety, and to taste­fulness in general, ex­tends to ex-Maxis artist John Cimino's wonder­fully real­ized char­acters & visuals — successes which might fly under the radar next to the game's other, more ob­vious distinct­ions.

Class act

<hr/>

<p>
Cock­tails with the upper crust: dukes, direct­ors, heir­esses, barons; a jangling, clink­ing pageant of dif­ferent bodies & costumes.
</p>
<p>
For a tight­ly focused, depth-obsessed indie, <cite>SpyParty</cite> nails divers­ity on multi­ple fronts: in the mis­sions, in the venues, in styles of play & kinds of players, but especial­ly in its coterie of sharp­ly dressed elites.
</p>
<p>
Though many ethnic­ities, ages & sensibil­ities are re­present­ed, the differ­ences be­tween each char­acter end up being pretty minor.
</p>
<p>
It's ex­pected that the spy will ( most of the time ) random­ly roll the cast for the match; if you're play­ing <cite>SpyParty</cite> for real, games will never boil down to simply guess­ing which social­ite your op­ponent chose to pilot.
</p>
<p>
That being said, char­acters do have slight vari­ations in width, height, walk­ing speed & anim­ations for bug­ging the ambas­sador & there are a few char­acters in part­icular who are, let's say, more dif­ferent: Drs. M & N, <abbr>aka</abbr> Plain Twin & Bling Twing, Mr. I <abbr>aka</abbr> Wheels & Mr. S <abbr>aka</abbr> Smallman.
</p>
<p>
The ident­ical twins, obvi­ously, are hard to tell apart, while Wheels' wheel­chair & Smallman's dwarf­ism make them short enough to effect­ively hide be­hind other party members, en­abling bolder tactics & even some­times avoid­ing the sniper's bullet.
</p>
<p>
Thank­fully, <cite>SpyParty</cite> is (maybe not 100% but) <b>essentially</b> self-bal­ancing; on certain venues (like <dfn>Gallery</dfn>) &	 for cert­ain snipers, these char­acters' predi­lection for cheese can earn them a high­light just for being who they are.
</p>
<p>
I think this works out pretty well; while the most phys­ically anom­alous char­acters afford some of the cheek­iest strat­egies & thus find them­selves the butt of jokes more often prob­ably than the others, this seems to be some­thing the game's com­munity is gener­ally sens­itive to & re­frains from cruel­ly or in­appro­priate­ly over­elabor­ating.
</p>
<p>
<cite>SpyParty</cite> doesn't pre­tend that every­one's the same, but the vari­ance, like the micro, isn't over­ly de­termin­ative.
</p>
<p>
Cimino & Hecker's char­acter designs show­case many of <cite>SpyParty</cite>'s core themes: divers­ity, proport­ion, taste­fulness, visual density & human­ism. The sil­houettes (ap­preciable on <dfn>Teien</dfn>) are varied & dis­tinct in a way that feels utter­ly natural for the fict­ion, but it's the faces that, on closer in­spection, show some serious skill: the sculpt­ing, shading, text­uring & anim­ation is... it looks fine, it looks how it should look, right? but look at other video game char­acters; now look again at <cite>SpyParty</cite>'s: skin tones are consist­ently warm & sat­urated, ex­pressions are leg­ible with­out be­ing ex­agger­ated, hair doesn't look like it's pro­truding nois­ily from some ortho­gonal uni­verse.
</p>
<p>
The ident­ities of mat­erials are sub­ordin­ated to the ident­ities of <b>persons</b>; <cite>Team Fortress 2</cite> would be a fair compar­ison, though <cite>SpyParty</cite>'s designs rely less on styli­zation, hit­ting on a love­ly <a href="http://www.spyparty.com/2012/08/27/the-new-spyparty-character-art-style/" target="_blank">midground</a> drawn in large part from 20<sup>th</sup> cent­ury fashion illus­tration.
</p>
<p>
While SpyParty on the whole pur­sues a human­istic natural­ism, veri­simil­itude does take a couple little scratches here and there; main­ly it's the clip­ping: in a game about a bunch of people crowd­ed in reg­ular-sized rooms, grab­bing drinks, gest­icul­ating & plant­ing track­ing devices on each other's butt­ocks, there's bound to be some body parts vying for similar territory — so, they clip — pretty often; you get used to these bodies' hit­boxes being smaller than in most other games, which, in its own way, be­speaks the in­timacy em­braced by Hecker's design — and the shrug he offers this basic prob­lem be­speaks, I be­lieve, his prudence.

Better attention
</h3>
<hr/>

<p>
Which­ever way the com­merc­ial cookie crum­bles come 1.0, Chris Hecker is clear­ly play­ing the long game; and de­spite my stomp­ing on a print out of a hypo­thetical 7.5/10 review citing <q>steep learning curve</q> this, <q>ped­estrian present­ation</q> that, <q>no single-play­er camp­aign</q> — I think it's ultim­ately gonna work out.
</p>
<p>
Though prob­ably low on meme­ability ( and obvi­ously with­out the back­ing of any sort of market­ing team ), a pos­sible advant­age that <cite>SpyParty</cite>'s Hitchcock­ian puppet theatre has for broad­cast is its psycho­logical immediacy & delicious potent­ial for drama­tic irony; match comment­ary pro­vided by cast­ers like WarningTrack tries to ex­plain the cog­nizance & intent­ion of both players in a way that can make you the viewer a better player & that helps to dis­tinguish the current compet­itors as indiv­iduals.
</p>
<p>
There's more con­tent planned too, of course: some­thing about the sniper act­ivating the secur­ity guard; dossiers for each char­acter — General's, for example, let­ting you know that he never re­fuses a drink; an­other mis­sion or two, prob­ably.
</p>
<p>
All wel­come, but the neat thing is that ad­vanced game modes al­ready feel im­possible to get a comp­lete handle on; keep­ing track of 8 mis­sions with all the com­motion on <dfn>Veranda</dfn> or <dfn>Moderne</dfn> already scrapes pain­fully against the limits of <i>homo sapiens</i>' short-term memory.
</p>
<p>
Guess we'll just have to evolve — good thing Hecker works slow!

<strong>In a near­by</strong> uni­verse <cite>SpyParty</cite> is quaint; in this one, it's down­right sub­versive.
</p>
<p>
Rather than pro­voking bore­dom, its taste­fully bland, thorough­ly decent urban­ity is re­fresh­ing, even brave; more re­fresh­ing still is the ex­perience of act­ually play­ing it, of meet­ing its re­spect­ful demand for your com­plete attent­ion, massag­ing out the de­fault pro­gram of ab­surd fidget­ing that other games have rout­ed through your peev­ish little brain.

Video games can be a wonder­ful way to re­incarnate as some troglo­dytic mutant or wistful­ly sent­ient bumper car — to alien­ate your conscious­ness, in­duce halluc­inations, wind you into rhythms that seem ex­cav­ated from some ancest­ral marrow.
