Vocalcity at 25

<p class="incipit">
<strong>Sometime</strong> in 2022 I became frank­ly obsess­ed with <cite>Vocalcity</cite>, Finn­ish prod­ucer Luomo's (<abbr>aka</abbr> Vladislav Delay <abbr>aka</abbr> Sasu Ripatti) 2000 debut.
</p>
<p>
I've histor­ic­ally been pretty partial to what's called <dfn>micro­house</dfn> — and after all, that makes sense; if it's the meet­ing place for mini­mal tech­no, dub, glitch & deep house then yeah, let me in — and <cite>Vocalcity</cite> is wide­ly consid­erend a mile­stone in the sub­genre's develop­ment.
</p>
<p>
Back when I start­ed getting into elec­tronic music (we're talking prob­ably 2010), I must have come across <cite>Vocalcity</cite> on some <s>best of the 2000s</s> lists, scrubbed through 4 or 5 of its 6 10-minute-plus tracks & sort of wond­ered what the fuss was about.
</p>
<p>
Skimming the surface, it prob­ably sound­ed mono­tonous (oh no!), reticent, schol­astic & unutter­ably <b>European</b> — like a bio­fuel-blooded battery of stain­less steel pistons pump­ing away at nothing, domin­ated by the sort of jejune synth vamps which wriggle their way through the begin­ning of its first track, <dfn>Market</dfn>. 
</p>
<p>
Well, I've given the whole thing many attent­ive listens now and I think it may just be the best dance long-player ever made — at least for my purp­oses.
</p>
<p>
It braids to­gether all these wonder­ful strands of electro­nic music — dub techno's roil­ing depth, glitch's <abbr>CD</abbr>-spectral near-plane surgery, house's huffy disco dream­scapes — in such a serene, almost bland way, per­fectly poised be­tween Mid­west grit & Nordic glamour — it doesn't really feel con­trived or even particul­arly provoc­ative; but the gen­eral form is these long, tectonic­ally shift­ing grooves — at first feel­ing like exer­cises — warmups — itchy, a little slinky, insist­ent... and then, at their own org­anic, self-assured pace — and with unim­peachable timing — they mature into these deep, immer­sive, deeply sexy & gener­ous medit­ations.

<p class="incipit">
<strong>In the end</strong> <cite>Vocalcity</cite> doesn't really sound <s>micro</s> at all — it sounds mass­ive, envelop­ing, circad­ian; and what seemed like end­less fore­play, if you stick it out, winds up punch­ing a ticket to honest-to-god cathar­sis.
</p>
<p>
One parti­cularly aud­acious trick that really gets my goose­bumps bump­ing is how it'll fore­shadow some vocal pay­load — a full track in ad­vance some­times — sending it flutter­ing through the <i>presque vu</i> peri­phery like an ori­gami dove; or when the vocals do enter in earn­est, the keys might drag a step be­hind, the kick drum follow­ing later still.
</p>
<p>
These teases & tugs are sort of <abbr title="electronic dance music">EDM</abbr>'s bread & butter, but in Ripatti's hands this stuff isn't cheap, it's ex­quisite — virtu­osic even — <s>the man</s> indeed.

<h3>
Market
</h3>
<p>
We kick things off with that sticky stab + bend synth riff, Morse code bass tapping on your fore­head.
</p>
<p>
Sharp in­takes of breath; a sunny warble like Snell's window; faint, spiral­ing whines; a pele­ton of bike gear tune-ups.
</p>
<p>
It's not until 4:48 that a vocal at the verb­al stage even enters, after which the rhythm takes on an ex­plicit 2-step shuffle.
</p>
<p>
At 8:16 the tele­phonic e­piano drops out for a moment and every­thing relaxes into an aqua­rian languor.
</p>
<p>
At 9:54, the synth from earlier re­turns, but pitched higher, per­forming a little seesaw parody of its orig­inal <i>ostinato</i>, before the track ultim­ately dissi­pates, glow­ing with sero­tonin, into its achey <i>denoue­ment</i>.

Class

<p>
<dfn>Class</dfn> might be the best ex­ample of how <cite>Vocalcity</cite> re­wards your patience, how it evolves what could be workman­like techno clichés into chrism­al, comely, volupt­iously filli­greed dance­floor sex-vespers.
</p>
<p>
After the first four minutes' jazzy, in­souciant e­piano, paper­y snare-claps, froggy synth cate­chisms & subtly stacked vocal re­frain (<q>Nothing to do others can't do</q>), the track drops into a spartan, hard-stepping funk drill.
</p>
<p>
But then at 4:51, the drums briefly spin back­wards, a female coo soft­ly pre­sides, and we shift almost sub­limin­ally into an­other chord: a balmy, purple C-sharp minor 9.
</p>
<p>
It's almost shock­ing to me how deft & power­ful that moment is; it's really, <b>really</b> funky.

<h3>
Synkro
</h3>
<figure class="right">
<img class="transparent" src="images/essays/vocalcity/synkro.png">
</figure>
<p>
Prob­ably the most repet­itive track on the album — 14 minutes of tauto­logical come-ons & pump­ing dia­phragm-like bass — but oh my lord is it just slow-cooked deep house per­fection.
</p>
<p>
Against a vortex of dubby creaks & scrapes bubbling with reedy sax quacks, Ripatti mass­ages from a Rhodes these glib, blues­y mordents.
</p>
<p>
On Pangea time, the groove un­furls: the cicada chirp of a hallucin­ogenic­ally tact­ile 303 — backing female vocals echo­ing past in half-silvered frag­ments — at 10:14, an industrial-scale steam-sigh border­ing on in­decency.
</p>
<p>
Stoner­ific dub canyons carved out with the phero­mone-laced sweat of the deep­est, most calli­pygian house.

<h3>
The Right Wing
</h3>
<p>
Track 4 I for a while just thought of as a bridge be­tween the mesmeric <dfn>Synkro</dfn> & the titanic <dfn>Tessio</dfn>; but late­ly I've come to re­gard it as a connoisseur's case for the dist­inct pleasures of micro­house: a burb­ling, phlegm­atic & yet strange­ly genial jab of histamine.
</p>
<p>
It certain­ly nails the details: that guiro-beetle rattle, crump­led trump­et, noirish tine piano, vinyl <u>wib-wub</u> zipper.
</p>
<p>
But it’s that long, diffuse, dream-logic tail wind­ing into the next track — a woman raving (<q>she don't even notice me when I'm inside her soul</q>), an­other sniff­ling, airy pads, a phone ring­ing — and those eerie, grainy pre­views of the chorus to come — that really gives it its pur­pose.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>
Tessio
</h3>
<figure class="right">
<img class="transparent" src="images/essays/vocalcity/tessio.png">
</figure>
<p>
Here we are then: <dfn>Tessio</dfn>.
</p>
<p>
What a climax; truly one of the all-time great dance­floor anthems.
</p>
<p>
It builds so beauti­fully — acid bass swell­ing, woozy & elast­ic — stray voices flicker­ing like candle flames at a séance — an open hi-hat's quick­ly cut-off <u>sh!</u> — and when it gets there it <b>delivers</b>.
</p>
<p>
Male & female final­ly con­join­ed; 6:28's disco­delic tutti sting; 9 minutes in, the super­heroic barn­storm­ing of a Staples-style diva drenched in cathedral re­verb.
</p>
<p>
An almost brazen venture into senti­mental electro­pop ballad­ry, but re­tain­ing all the surround­ing sprezz­atura (the kick­drum doesn’t hit until 2 minutes in, the full four-to-the-floor 20 seconds after that), it’s with­out a doubt <cite>Vocalcity</cite>’s (if not millennial <abbr>EDM</abbr>'s) crown jewel & a triumph of soul in electro­nic music — the real thing.
</p>

<h3>
She-Center
</h3>
<p>
Luomo closes the album out with a neon-streaked fly­ing taxi ride: feline e­piano, zips & zaps, wine-dark pads, the reggae-est bass organ yet.
</p>
<p>
A come-hither harem of <abbr>R&B</abbr> vocal­ics; a cacoph­onous clatter of Scientist-style <abbr title="sound effects">SFX</abbr>; finally, the ivory dry­ness of a muted nylon guitar & last squelch­ing stabs of that ever-present 303.

<p class="incipit">
<strong>It’s awesome</strong> stuff; and though I haven’t been spinn­ing it for 25 years straight, I have to imag­ine it’s an un­usually sturdy & re­liable dance record.
</p>
<p>
Swollen, tact­ile, aspir­ated, sultry — to me <cite>Vocalcity</cite> may be the album that best delivers on the prom­ise of what a long-play­ing dance record can be: simult­aneous­ly fractal cent­ri­fuge & time-lapse fjord — this trance-inducing yet infin­itely ex­plorable psych­edelic bio­mechan­ical insect­oid sex arc­ology... thing.
</p>
<p class="halmos">
Don’t skim; get in there — it’s deep.
