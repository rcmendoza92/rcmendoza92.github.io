Willhelm Müller's snowshoes & lyrical 5D
</h3>
</hgroup>

<section>

<p class="incipit">
<strong>Song lyrics</strong> tend to struggle on the page; with­out their music­al sett­ings, they can seem tedi­ous, obvi­ous, vague, naïve, lack­ing con­vict­ion or irony.
</p>
<p>
One except­ion I've come across is the <cite>Winter­reise</cite> (or <a href="https://hampsongfoundation.org/resource/winterreise-texts-and-translations/" target="_blank">Winter Journey</a>) written by the German poet & sold­ier Willhelm Müller & famous­ly adapt­ed into a cyc­le of 24 art songs by Franz Schubert short­ly be­fore the comp­oser's death in 1828.
</p>
<p>
I can’t read the origi­nal German & so can’t assess their act­ual pros­ody, but in Eng­lish any­way they basic­ally seem like typi­cal early Roman­tic poet­ry.
</p>
<p>
How­ever — especi­ally as lyrics — I think they’re per­fect.
</p>
</p>
<p>
I had listen­ed to the full cycle on my own late last year & then in Jan­uary my mom & I saw it per­formed as the first con­cert of the Chamber Music Soci­ety of Lincoln Center’s 2023 Winter Fest­ival, with bari­tone Nikolay Borchev & pian­ist Wu Han.
</p>
<p>
There is some­thing to see­ing a man stand up there & sing two dozen somber songs at you for an hour — you can imag­ine the Bieder­meier liv­ing room, the friends gather­ed around in their even­ing wear — the sing­er stands up & puts his hand on the lid of the piano, the other on his chest, and an hour later re­ceives grac­ious if some­what be­mused applause, and with a <i title="shudder, shiver">schauder</i> sits back down.
</p>
<p>
But read­ing along as these words were sung, and read­ing them again after the con­cert was over, I some­how felt that de­spite the magnan­imity & fire­side glow of Schu­bert’s music, the lyrics let me in — all the way in — while the music in some ways kept me at a dist­ance.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I dunno, they’re <em>ant­ique Germ­an songs</em>; I can en­joy & appreci­ate common pract­ice Euro­pean art music but — what­ever it is — the plunk­ing caden­ces, the syrupy earnest­ness, the oval <i>bel canto</i> sing­ing  — some­thing, at least for now, stands in the way.
</p>
<p>
The <b>lyrics</b>, though, strike me as gen­uine bur­ied treas­ure; I just can’t imag­ine be­ing a profess­ional poet & not being over­come with jeal­ousy read­ing this stuff.
</p>
<p>
A young man stands out­side the house of his not-to-be sweet­heart, writes good­night on her gate & sets off through the town & the surround­ing wilder­ness on a cold wint­er night & into the morn­ing, where he joins a vag­rant hurdy-gurdy player, resolv­ing to follow him around from town to town sing­ing these very songs.
</p>
<p>
Un­forced, un­pretent­ious, but comp­lete­ly thor­ough, comp­lete­ly integ­ral in its explo­ration & develop­ment of the theme — a glitter­ing cas­cade of fresh & con­vinc­ing de­vices.
</p>
<p>
Talk about element­al; 24 dinky old lyrics, with a con­cept­ual narra­tive arma­ture & every­thing, and not a hint of bull­shit; not even the bull­shit en­demic to so much Roman­tic poet­ry — swoon­ing to death & all that.
</p>
<p>
 Better than clever, but not quite the serend­ipitous dogger­el Auden was chas­ing either; more like Keats’ best vers­es: clear & love­ly & haunt­ing­ly sin­cere.
</p>
<p>
There's also the per­sever­ance of the speak­er, the fact that the major­ity of these poems take place in the lucid morn­ing after rather than the blust­ery night before, the myst­er­ious aur­oral reso­ution — this stuff does­n’t just seem like an echo of the shrill hyst­eria of adol­escence (though many of its epi­sodes are eer­ily famil­iar); I think the diffi­cult per­egrin­ation of moult­ing & mourn­ing & <b>exp­erience</b> it descr­ibes so plaus­ibly is al­ways rele­vant, al­ways pain­ful; to me, this is spirit­ual nourish­ment — courage.

<p class="incipit">
<strong>I’ve been</strong> writ­ing some lyrics of my own; one of them even takes its re­frain from a line in <cite>Der Linden­baum</cite>:
<blockquote>
Even in the dark­ness I had to close my eyes
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
I like the con­straints you get with song­writing: it's a pop­ulist form of poet­ry that still touches mill­ions of people with ears & not just enthus­iasts; audi­ences have been trained since child­hood on pop­ular song's con­vent­ions & sub­versions — with­in a given genre one still feels the breeze from a slight­ly cracked Over­ton win­dow.
</p>
<p>
I think of a good song lyric as a kind of tens­ile pavil­ion or indust­rial-grade dream­catcher, each little phrase adding ripples through the silk retic­ulum; you don't want to over­load the frame, but you also don't want any spir­its to escape.
</p>
<p>
My own taste these days seems to vaci­llate be­tween the hope­less­ly ob­scure & the utter­ly plain, some­thing like Jim O’Rourke’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DssjusVkNCg" target="_blank">Good Times</a> on the one hand & Nick Drake’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gYtqGgSTuo" target="_blank">Which Will</a> on the other.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I’ve come up with a sort of rubric for my­self which I’d like to share with any­one else who might be writ­ing or study­ing song lyrics — you could think of it as a kind of weighted star chart or implicit phase diagram of esthetic desiderata; I would­n’t recomm­end try­ing to <em>gen­erate</em> a song from it (though I think its spokes do indic­ate some­thing about poet­ic germs), but for re­view & re­vis­ion, I think it could be use­ful; it has been for me.
</p>
<p class="halmos">
Also, not every song needs to or could real­ly be expect­ed to maxim­ize each aspect; typic­ally it seems like a good lyric is strong in two & a great lyric is strong in three, espe­cially the higher prior­ity val­ues; but as you'll see be­low, these criteria over­lap & inter­act in subtly sym­path­etic ways that can make them more or less comp­at­ible with­in a given idiom.
