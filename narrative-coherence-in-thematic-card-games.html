Narrative coherence in thematic card games
</h2>
</hgroup>

<section>

<p class="incipit">
<strong>Partly</strong> prompted by the recent in­flux of digi­tal card battlers, I've been think­ing about the <dfn title="theory of interpretation">hermen­eutics</dfn> of custom­izable & them­atic card games: how we narrate them to our­selves, what they re­present & how they re­present it, what themes they're in­clined to­ward & under what con­ditions they achieve them­atic felic­ity.
</p>
<p>
Your <cite>Slay the Spire</cite>s and <cite>Monster Train</cite>s can gen­erate some interest­ing optim­ization puzzles, but even a <cite>Griftlands</cite> which tries to model diplo­macy misses out on a lot of the lit­erary supple­ness I think the form­at allows for.
</p>
<p>
Many of these games con­sist of a dis­crete series of attrit­ion con­tests: reducing your op­ponent's re­solve while try­ing not to over­exert your­self, your over­all pos­ition judged more on pre­pared­ness for the next (or final) en­counter than on your rela­tive advant­age (init­iative/tempo, mater­ial, develo­pment) in the skir­mish at hand.
</p>
<p>
To be fair, I would­n't ex­pect a deck-draft­ing rogue­lite to hang its challenge on the same struct­ure as, say, a con­structed format double-elim­ination tourn­ament; so it's not just the fault of that part­icular sub­genre then; a number of per­fectly phys­ical 2-player duels, like <cite>Flesh and Blood</cite>, suffer, as I see it, from the same pugil­istic cable­cam literal­ness.

<p class="incipit">
<strong>As with</strong> any story we first might ask: what's the nature of the con­flict? and who's show­ing up?
</p>
<p>
We might be com­manders of armies or we might be an army of one; in­trigues might be div­ided into sep­arate arenas, as in the poli­tical & mili­tary clashes of <cite>Legend of the Five Rings</cite>; we might be cyn­ical opportun­ists play­ing inter­est groups off each other or we might be commit­ted ideo­logues; in any case, the card games I cher­ish tend to be these pano­ramic tapest­ries woven by their players.
</p>
<p>
For all its faults, <cite>Magic: The Gathering</cite> excels at the grand­iose, tele­scoping out to cosmic cata­clysms & in to indiv­idual alley­ways: it's all one; it all matters.
</p>
<p>
This isn't just be­cause it plays so fast & loose with its fict­ional con­straints; it's also be­cause in its world the stuff every­thing is made of has a <em>moral sub­stance</em>.
</p>
<p>
I think they flub­bed the art direct­ion when they started print­ing lands with cork­screw spires & shit; the source of all this hulla­baloo — plagues, holo­causts, sand­castles rising and being washed away — is sup­posed to be the im­manent moral potent­ial of nat­ural reserv­oirs in prim­ordial repose.
</p>
<p>
Anyway; I'm getting off track.
</p>
<p>
While there can cert­ainly be a satisfy­ing drama­tic arc to those pro­gression-focused <abbr>PvE</abbr> af­fairs, especial­ly when they lean into the Faust­ian (<u>ahem</u> <cite>Imbroglio</cite> <u>ahem</u>), there's some­thing especial­ly in­terest­ing to me about the almost sit­com-like narra­tive space many <abbr>CCG</abbr>s oper­ate in: all-in one-offs embed­ded with­in, and having no direct impact on, a slow­ly evol­ving yet ultim­ately abid­ing dead­lock.

<p class="incipit">
<strong>The participants</strong> in these battles typic­ally re­present some fact­ion; fact­ions, suits, colors, class­es, what­ever you want to call them — they're extreme­ly import­ant.
</p>
<p>
Not going to para­phrase the whole <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/timmy-johnny-and-spike-revisited-2006-03-20-2" target="_blank">psychographics</a> spiel here, but basic­ally your fact­ions re­present equiv­alently sized slices of the design pie & thus your game­play's ex­pressive arche­types; I would further argue that a given card in such a game is to be judged first on its fidel­ity to which­ever faction claims it.
</p>
<p>
Part of my whole point here is that there's a sort of <em>im­plicit hier­archy</em> to which players appeal for nar­rative satis­faction.
</p>
<p>
So the first crit­erion is how hap­pily the card in quest­ion ex­presses the atti­tude of its suit; and since a key feat­ure of the genre is its module-dif­fused com­plex­ity and Calvin­ball-esque abund­ance of ex­ceptions, one of those mod­ules is especial­ly wel­come when it covers an aspect of its fact­ion's strat­agem not al­ready spoken for.
</p>
<p>
Think about it: even if they end up wild­ly un­balanced, the love­liest cards are al­most al­ways those fact­ion-def­ining pro­verbs:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/342/lightning-bolt" target="_blank">Lightning Bolt</a>
</li>
<li>

<p class="incipit">
<strong>Of secondary</strong> importance is the card's inter­nal consist­ency, how in­genious­ly it con­veys its niche through its illus­tration, powers, & tax­onomy.
</p>
<p>
Maybe the most spine-ting­ling ex­ample of this sort of com­pression I can think of is <cite>Netrunner</cite>'s <a href="https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/08087" target="_blank">Paparazzi</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
You are tagged. Prevent all meat damage.
</blockquote>

<p>
Divine. (and I might even argue not just neu­tral be­cause it's not ex­clusive to the Shaper, Anarch or Criminal play­book but be­cause it's act­ually lift­ed from <abbr>NBN</abbr>'s!)
</p>
<p>
Finally there's how each card inter­acts with the others: the oper­ational logics — caus­ality.
</p>
<p>
This is with­out a doubt the hard­est matrix to pre­compute & the one players are most will­ing to over­look, or at least cross their eyes & view in soft focus.
</p>
<p>
Probably best to take the macro view here most of the time; even without out­right degen­eracy creep­ing in, it's obvi­ously im­possible to go around making sure that every pos­sible seq­uence of plays is un­impeach­ably plaus­ible with­in the fict­ion.
</p>
<p>
That being said, it's good fun to sur­vey your port­folio in <cite>Dominion</cite> or <cite>Race for the Galaxy</cite> <i>ex post facto</i> & ex­plain how one thing led to an­other; <cite>Dominion</cite> is a good example act­ually of a card game whose sem­antics are some­what re­versed: I struggle to relate a card's power to its name until it's clink­ing against the others in the pool.
</p>
<p>
If there are abid­ing princip­les which secure co­herence in the face of em­ergence, they're myst­erious.
</p>
<p>
In some sense I think it's games' job to be Charlie Brown kick­ing the foot­ball, if the foot­ball is co­herence, and Lucy is uh, analys­is? and Charlie Brown is fict­ion... or I just said he's games? or the game is kick­ing the ball... right...

Assorted thoughts
</h3>
<hr/>

<p>
It's not just for nerd­dom's sake that so many them­atic card games deal in the dark arts; magic is essential­ly a black box by which one can hand-wave vari­ous collaps­ings of time, space, &c.
</p>
<p>
Magic can be elem­ental en­ergy as in <cite>Magic: The Gathering</cite>, a cryst­al ball as in <cite>Arkham Horror</cite>, or even cyber­space as in <cite>Netrunner</cite>; it's not necessar­ily law­less, but it is a short­cut.
</p>

<p>
The early game can be awk­ward when players start with no­thing on the board; aside from bal­ance con­sider­ations, I think Corp having the first turn in <cite>Netrunner</cite> lets me brack­et the secur­ing of that init­ial cap­ital out­side of the time frame in which the up­coming battle takes place; I'd have to do some gruel­ing mental gymnast­ics to ration­alize it in some­thing like <cite>Arkham</cite> though.
</p>
<p>
Boot­strapping is, I think, some­thing worth think­ing a little hard­er about than they prob­ably thought about it in the '90s.

<p>
What do basic units of cur­rency re­present?
</p>
<p>
In <cite>Netrunner</cite>, Corp & Runner both spend <s>cred­its</s>, but I see these as be­ing rela­tive approx­imations of what a multi­national corp­oration & a lone hacker would con­sider ex­pensive respect­ively; <cite>Arkham Horror</cite>'s <s>resources</s> are even vaguer, stand­ing in for cash, sup­plies, schem­atics, favor, and vari­ous other fungi­bles.

<p>
I enjoy having some ground­ing — though it need­n't be 1:1 — for the primi­tive data struct­ures as well, i.e. the play regions where the cards reside.
</p>
<p>
If one of the great themes of card games is miti­gating vari­ance & the pri­mary source of var­iance is the shuf­fling of the deck & the deck is a <em>stack</em> & that <em>stack</em> is your ava­tar's whole reper­toire of pos­sible tools, re­sources & tricks, then why is its order hid­den? what is meant by moving one of those possib­ilities from an ord­ered but en­crypt­ed <em>stack</em> into an un­ord­ered but de­crypt­ed <em>bag</em>, i.e. your hand?
</p>
<p>
An ex­ample of some over­ly lit­eral & baroque topo­logies are the loc­ation cards in <cite>Arkham Horror</cite>.
</p>
<p>
I under­stand the desire to chunk your haunt­ed house clue hunt into indiv­idual chambers, but the many, many absurd­ities that result make me wonder if may­be they should have tried to do some kind of flash­back mon­tage thing in­stead.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Doomtown</cite> has an eas­ier time of it, with <s>deeds</s> neigh­bor­ing each other left­-to-­right, an omni-­adjacent <s>town square</s> & a desig­nated <s>out-of-town</s> loc­ation — plus the <s>boot</s> ab­ility, which ex­hausts a <s>dude</s> in your em­ploy to send that shit­kicker to any loc­ation in one move; it also helps that <b>you</b> are not in any one loc­ation at a time, just your <s>dudes</s>.

<p>
So we have kinds of places where cards can be; what about kinds of cards?
</p>
<p>
Next to ident­ifying the fact­ions, this is the other princ­iple div­ision in the creat­ion of a them­atic card game.
</p>
<p>
It could be just 2, as in <cite>Race for the Galaxy</cite>'s <s>worlds</s> & <s>develop­ments</s>; it could mirror the num­ber of fact­ions, as in <cite>Magic</cite>'s 5 basic types (plus lands).
</p>
<p>
The only class­ific­ation that gen­eral­ly gives me pause is my per­sonal <i>bête noire</i>, <q>event</q>; what is an <b>event</b>? a delib­erate scheme? a happy coinc­idence? I'm gonna need some­thing a little more <b>telic</b>.

Being a cross­breed of card games & <abbr>RPG</abbr>s, the <abbr>CCG</abbr> is poised to re­flect the breadth of con­flict types proper <abbr>RPG</abbr>s can ac­count for; the <abbr title="tabletop roleplaying game">TTRPG</abbr> <cite>Torchbearer</cite>, for ex­ample, pre­sents these pos­sible tests of mettle:
<ul>
<li>
Banish
</li>
<li>
Abjure
</li>
<li>
Capture
</li>
<li>
Convince
</li>
<li>
Convince Crowd
</li>
<li>
Drive Off
</li>
<li>
Kill
</li>
<li>
Pursue
</li>
<li>
Flee
</li>
<li>
Trick
</li>
<li>
Riddle
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Clearly there's more to life than trading blows; but even if your con­flict ambit is limit­ed to bigger-number-wins vol­leys, you could pre­sent it how Reiner Knizia's <cite>Blue Moon</cite> does: cere­monial dis­plays of strength in­tended to con­vince some aud­ience (in <cite>Blue Moon</cite>'s case, elem­ental drag­ons) of the contest­ant's legit­imacy; or you could do some­thing like <cite>Doomtown</cite>: chess-y shuff­ling & step­ping, stare­-downs & freeze­-outs followed by the ex­clamation point of a rauc­ous shoot­out.
</p>
<p>
 Spoils, egress, brink­man­ship, screen­ing, feints, honor, morale... attrit­ion isn't every­thing.

One of my favor­ite things about play­ing Runner in <cite>Netrunner</cite> is flip­ping through my deck like a rolo­dex: taking <a href="https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/07036" target="_blank">odd jobs</a>, call­ing in <a href="https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/05031" target="_blank">favors</a>, lay­ing low in <a href="https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01030" target="_blank">friends of friends'</a> apart­ments; re­inforced by the stroke of genius where­by your <abbr>HP</abbr> is re­presented by the number of cards in your hand, a Runner's cards real­ly feel like their <b>options</b>, and it's only when you've ex­hausted your opt­ions — or when they've been ex­hausted for you — that you're truly dead in the water.

<p>
One last con­sider­ation when them­ing a card game is <dfn>tempo</dfn>; the clashes played out be­tween the inter­ested part­ies are play­able (as op­posed to pre­-scripted) be­cause their reso­lution is <abbr title="to be determined">TBD</abbr>, the matter not yet set­tled.
</p>
<p>
What this means is that even if the odds seem stacked to­ward one side — like, say, to­ward the multi­national corp­oration — the other side still has access to some <b>some­thing</b> that can tip the scales, or at least eke out what that side would con­sider a vict­ory.
</p>
<p>
They may be more nim­ble, they may be able to harn­ess pop­ular sup­port, they may, as ment­ioned earl­ier, use <em>magic</em> or <em>hack­ing</em> or some other heur­istic to sur­vive & thrive; but it's always a <b>race</b>; a race to some level of sec­urity; a crit­ical per­iod when legit­imacy is still up for grabs.
