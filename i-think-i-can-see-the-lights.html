Cass McCombs' County Line
</h3>
</hgroup>

<section>

<p class="incipit">
<strong>County Line</strong>, the single from Cass McCombs’ 2011 album <cite>Wit's End</cite>, was accomp­anied by two ent­irely differ­ent music videos.
</p>
<p>
The first time I list­ened to this song, in 2011, it was watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gULe10y9xU" target="_blank">first video</a> re­leased, direct­ed by Aaron Brown; some­time later, if mem­ory serves, this vid­eo was taken down from Domino's You­Tube chan­nel & re­placed with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOcnITphyjk" target="_blank">another</a> before being reup­loaded on McCombs' own channel years later; but if you watch that orig­inal video, you might not be sur­prised to hear that it perman­ently color­ed my impress­ion of a piece of music which has pro­ved, for me, a cons­tant com­panion.

<strong>Grisly & intimate</strong> but ultim­ately undis­closing, this muzzy, scuzzy <abbr>DV</abbr> montage of need­les, nood­les, bar burl­esques & box fans inst­antly set to boil­ing the ineff­able fore­boding simmer­ing under­neath the aw-shucks dirge it furn­ishes; and like the song it­self, it’s an enigma — one which, like a William Eggleston photo (or like his own night vision video­tape <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnpvy4fdeDs" target="_blank">Stranded in Canton</a>) threat­ens banal­ity as much as ab­jection — but I care, maybe more than I should — I feel spoken to, made <b>privvy</b> to some­thing — and I want to know.
</p>
<p>
Where did this come from?
</p>
Who are these people?
<p>
What's this about?
</p>
<p>
A county?
</p>
<pre>
I can smell the columbine
</pre
<p>
... Colorado?

<p class="incipit">
<strong>In the language</strong> of <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/the-language-of-flowers-an-alphabet-of-floral-emblems-1857" target="_blank">flowers</a>, the columbine is <s>the emb­lem of de­ceived lovers, ingrat­itude, faith­less­ness.</s>
</p>
<p>
McCombs addre­sses his <i title="troubadour song complaining of lady's behavior">maldit</i>, in a sur­pris­ing gesture of <a href="https://www.theonion.com/i-95-diagnosed-with-highway-cancer-1819574370" target="_blank">animism</a>, to a county — not even a town.
</p>
<p>
An alt-country affect­ation?
</p>
<p>
An inver­sion of Chuck Berry’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUVIlph32dY" target="_blank">paeans</a> to driving?
</p>
<p>
Or an admiss­ion of the sort of desult­ory sub­urban anonym­ity snaked through in <cite>Twin Peaks: The Return</cite>?
</p>
<p>
<q>You never even tried to love me</q> he accu­ses in a sting­ing fals­etto, like a cotton ball soaked with alcohol; what­ever the source of his dis­appoint­ment, I feel it as my own: friends-of-friends & over­head lights & scuffed floors & Lustron houses among which you hoped you could sow love & comm­unity, some­how some­where let down on an un­shored drift to­ward per­fidy & obliv­ion.
</p>
<p>
But follow­ing that bitter burp of chag­rin is a flare of warmth in the back of the throat — a cara­mel after­taste: pity.

<p class="incipit">
<strong>Though the emotion</strong> is diffi­cult, the color is fami­liar: brushed drums, that bleary Rhodes, an organ's prickly whine; the sound of driving back­ward into the past, like open­ing the door to your old apart­ment in a dream: more ambiv­alence than mere nost­algia.
</p>
<p>
Better than any retro­grade parap­hrase I know of, <cite>County Line</cite> stows a dag­ger in the boot of shag­gy <abbr>FM</abbr> roots rock, arm­ing these aff­able cues with a poign­ant & cred­ible nau­sea.
</p>
<p>
Partly this is down to the sand­washed subtle­ty of the accompan­iment: the penta­gram of left-hand e­piano desc­ending from the first invo­cation of the title; the lean into the organ which re­freshes the chorus half­way through; the bash­ful alter­nate pick­ing on the slight­ly out of tune guitar & then its spark­ing to life in the coda; the cresc­endo of tom hits under­lining <q>columbine.</q>

<p class="incipit">
<strong>Like Bill Eyden’s</strong> drudgy percus­sion on <cite>A Whiter Shade of Pale</cite>, the drums on <cite>County Line</cite> pave the narc­otic groove with a gris­tly artic­ulation — hesit­ating, almost amat­eurish at first blush, but as the song un­furls, these egg­shell taps & rum­pled fills re­veal, like an­other sec­ret, an exquis­itely sens­itive & dyn­amic Dixie soul feel.
</p>
<p>
The march-like duple pulse seems to simult­aneously canter for­ward & stra­ggle behind, per­fect for conj­uring that twin sens­ation of prop­ulsion & iner­tia — of being pulled inex­orably back­ward — that is so key to the song’s planet-struck spell.
</p>
<p>
This omi­nous note is sound­ed as soon as you hit play: dim­ming the lights with a bale­ful sub­mediant B minor (<q>on my way</q>), a twinge of mis­placed nost­algia moves us to the dom­inant A (<q>old county</q>); then we temp­orarily take refuge in a bitt­erly ironic tonic D (<q>hoping nothing’s</q>); wince with apprehen­sion at a sec­ondary dom­inant F-sharp major (<q>changed</q>); choke back the bile of a rue­ful super­tonic E minor (<q>pain</q>); and raise our gaze once again to the hori­zon’s in­finite A (<q>never ending</q>).

<p class="incipit halmos">
<strong>A stunning</strong> cons­piracy of words & music — and weird­ly unique in Cass McCombs’ catalog; he has other good songs — <cite>Brighter!</cite>, <cite>Morning Shadows</cite>, <cite>I Went To The Hospital</cite>, <cite>It’s Getting Colder</cite> — but for all his occ­ult allus­ions & cape-twirls, there’s no­thing else this hyp­notic, this <b>amaur­otic</b>, this lived-in, with this vicar­ious power — no­thing that I hang from my rear­view mirror like my own per­sonal amu­let the way I do <cite>County Line</cite>.
